1. Description

- Test 1: Any language (required)
Write a program that outputs the integers from 1 to 99 but on some conditions prints a string instead:

• when the integer is a multiple of 3 print “Open” instead of the number,

• when it is a multiple of 7 print “Source” instead of the number,

• when it is a multiple of both 3 and 7 print “OpenSource” instead of the number.

- Test 2: Any language (required)
Expand a random range from 0-5 to 0-7. Given a function rand5() that returns a random float in the range [0,5] with a uniform distribution, write a function that returns a random float in the range [0,7] using only rand5() and keeping a uniform distribution.

- Test 3: Any language (required)
Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns the sum of the list items that represents an integer (skipping the other items)

- Test 4: Any language (required)
Write a recursive version of the previous function (or an iterative version if you already did a recursive version).

- Test 5: Regular Expression (required)
Write a regular expression to match strings containing both “Pikaway” and “#rules” in any order.
